I thoroughly enjoy keeping to a strict routine for both my physical and mental health and have done so for the entirety of my time at UT Austin. Recently, I have celebrated my 1000th consecutive workout (Saturday's optional). While I would suggest four or five days a week rather than six to seven, I cannot fathom the impact that consistent exercise has made on my life. That impact being not only on my physical health but also on my mindfulness and my ability to discern the value of long term changes in my behavior.

If you are looking to increase your awareness of your health, I unprofessionally suggest looking at your sleep and diet before a strict exercise routine. And a few things that I have noticed lately is my trained behavior that I tend not to notice throughout the day such as breathing and posture.
