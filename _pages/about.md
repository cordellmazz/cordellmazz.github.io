I am a electrical and computer engineering undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. However, my studies mainly focus on quantum information science, which is where the majority of my [(blissfully unaware) academic passion lies](https://xkcd.com/1861/). The research that I have done thus far is focused in [quantum communications and quantum photonics](link_to_NASA_talk).

A few of my other interests include composing and producing music, running a [pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) game, and [rigorous physical activity](/exercise/).

Please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/)!

## Highlights

### NASA Research

Last summer I interned with NASA GSFC's Space Communications and Navigation group researching quantum clock synchronization protocols.
Here is a talk I gave about my findings including a novel protocol I formulated that is based off of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08450)!

### Quantum Chess

As a sophomore, I worked with some very talented friends to create an extremely convoluted and ridiculous command line game named Qhess.
While not the most player-friendly game, the code it uses is pretty cool. It runs on a custom simulator since, at the time, Qiskit did not have the
functionality we needed and uses a fairly complex system to handle the unitary nature of each move. See the github repo [here](https://github.com/cordellmazz/qhess).
