I am a electrical and computer engineering undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. However, my studies mainly focus on quantum information science, which is where the majority of my [(blissfully unaware) academic passion lies](https://xkcd.com/1861/). The research that I have done thus far is focused in [quantum communications and quantum photonics](link_to_NASA_talk). 

A few of my other interests include composing and producing music, running a [pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) game, and [rigorous physical activity](/exercise/).

Please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/)!
