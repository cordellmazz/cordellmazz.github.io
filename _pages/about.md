I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin where I studied electrical and computer engineering as well as quantum information science. I am looking to continue my education through a PhD focused on distributed quantum computing and quantum networking combining my backgrounds in synchronization, photonics, and quantum information science! The research that I have done thus far is focused on [quantum communications, quantum information, and quantum photonics](#nasa-research).

A few of my other interests include composing and producing music, running a [Pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) game, and [rigorous physical activity](/exercise/).

Please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/)!

## NASA Research 2024

I continued my research with NASA GSFC's Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) group this Summer in quantum clock synchronization protocols through in lab implementations and data post-processing algorithms. I both implemented the protocol from last summer using photonics and I created two new post-processing algorithms that beat both industry and research standards! In addition to my first new technology report (NASA's process for filing patents), we submitted another report for the second algorithm which could find critical values in data that was 99.998% noise!

## NASA Research 2023

Last summer, I interned with NASA GSFC's SCaN group, researching quantum clock synchronization protocols.
Below is a talk I gave about my findings and work, including a novel protocol I formulated based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08450), for which NASA is now working on a patent!

## Revojam & Other Startups

Since late 2021, I have worked on multiple startups continuously, about 30 to 40 hours weekly through school and internships. They have covered different objectives like mitigating DMCA strikes for streamers, applying AI and language models to novel applications, and using trained models for heart health analysis from data taken by wearable hardware. Below is a video of a test of my first startup, which synchronized audio playback for an unlimited number of people from a dynamic music queue. We are testing it in one of UT's computer labs on 14 different Spotify accounts (notice that beautiful audio synchronization)!

## Software Engineering at Amazon

In the summer of 2022, I went to Seattle, Washington, to work as a software development engineering intern for Amazon's Catalog System Services division as part of their correctness team. I finished two projects for them: a data extraction client for interacting with one of Amazon's internal services and a data analytics UI, which dynamically analyzed and rendered weekly generated report data for our team's tool.

## Quantum Chess

As a sophomore, I worked with some very talented friends to create an extraordinarily convoluted and ridiculous command line game named Qhess. While not the most player-friendly game, the code it uses is pretty cool. It runs on a custom simulator since, at the time, Qiskit did not have the functionality we needed and required a fairly complex system to handle the unitary nature of each move. See the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/cordellmazz/qhess" target="_blank">here</a>.

This project was the third in a chain of quantum projects we worked on together. The others are a quantum simulator that had part of its core code utilized in Qhess and a parser for the OpenQASM language.
