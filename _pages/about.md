I am a electrical and computer engineering undergraduate senior at the University of Texas at Austin. However, my studies mainly focus on quantum information science, which is where the majority of my [(blissfully unaware)](https://xkcd.com/1861/) academic passion lies. The research that I have done thus far is focused in [quantum communications and quantum photonics](#nasa-research).

A few of my other interests include composing and producing music, running a [pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) game, and [rigorous physical activity](/exercise/).

Please feel free to [reach out to me](/contact/)!

## NASA Research
Last summer I interned with NASA GSFC's Space Communications and Navigation group researching quantum clock synchronization protocols.
Here is a talk I gave about my findings including a novel protocol I formulated that is based off of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08450) which NASA is now working on a patent for!

## Revojam & Other Startups
Since late 2021, I have worked continuously, about 30 to 40 hours each week through school and internships, on multiple startups. They have covered
different objectives like mitigating DMCA strikes for streamers, applying AI and language models to novel applications, and using trained models for heart health analysis from data taken by wearable hardware. Below is a video of a test of my first startup which synchronized audio playback for an unlimited number of people from a dynamic music queue. We are testing it in one of UT's computer labs on 14 different spotify accounts (notice that beautiful audio synchronization)!

## Software Engineering at Amazon
In the summer of 2022, I went to Seattle, Washington to work as a software development engineering intern for Amazon's Catalog System Services division as part of their correctness team. I finished two projects for them: a data extraction client for interacting with one of Amazon's internal services and a data analytics UI which dynamically analyzed and rendered weekly generated report data for our team's tool.

## Quantum Chess
As a sophomore, I worked with some very talented friends to create an extremely convoluted and ridiculous command line game named Qhess.
While not the most player-friendly game, the code it uses is pretty cool. It runs on a custom simulator since, at the time, Qiskit did not have the
functionality we needed and uses a fairly complex system to handle the unitary nature of each move. See the github repo <a href="https://github.com/cordellmazz/qhess" target="_blank">here</a>.

This project was third in a chain of quantum projects we worked on together. The other two being a quantum simulator who had part of its core code utilized in Qhess and the other a parser for the OpenQASM language.
